Opendbg is a powerful debugging platform that supports both user and kernel mode applications. This tool is designed to be cross-platform, but only Windows code analyzer is available today. The debugger kernel is a windows driver. UI is Qt-based (old one was wxWidgets-based), CLI is also available.
